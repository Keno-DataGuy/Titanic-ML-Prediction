# Titanic-ML-Prediction
Machine learning model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

This is the legendary Titanic ML competition on kaggle.
It is the best, first challenge for diving into machine learning.
The task is a simple one that requires the use of machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

### Data
The data has been split into two groups:
training set (train.csv)
test set (test.csv)

The training set is used to build the machine learning models. For the training set, the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger is provided. 
The test set is used to see how well the model performs on unseen data. For the test set, the ground truth for each passenger is not provided. 
These outcomes are what is predicted. For each passenger in the test set, the model trained is used to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.
